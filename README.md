# AI-ChatBot

Streamlit UI: The st.title displays a title on the web page, and the st.text_input allows the user to input text (this is how the chatbot receives messages).

Bot Response: When the user types something, the backend (chatbot_response function) is triggered, and the bot generates a response based on the input.

The chatbot uses the same Naive Bayes classifier to match user input with predefined intents and generate a response.
